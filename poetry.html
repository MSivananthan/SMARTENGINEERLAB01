                    <h3>Fire and Ice</h3>
Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
Some say in ice.<br>
From what I've tasted of desire<br>
I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
But if it had to perish twice,<br>
I think I know enough of hate<br>
To say that for destruction ice<br>
Is also great<br>
And would suffice.<br>

                        I hear men say to plow the snow.<br>
                        They cannot mean to plant it, though -<br>
                        Unless in bitterness to mock<br>
                        At having cultivated rock. <br>

                        <h3>The Road not Taken</h3>   
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
<br>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,<br>
<br>      
And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
<br>      
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.<br>

                            <h3>A Brook in the City</h3>
                            The farm house lingers, though averse to square<br>
                            With the new city street it has to wear<br>
                            A number in. But what about the brook<br>
                            That held the house as in an elbow-crook?<br>
                            I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength<br>
                            And impulse, having dipped a finger-length<br>
                            And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed<br>
                            A flower to try its currents where they crossed.<br>
                            The meadow grass could be cemented down<br>
                            From growing under pavements of a town;<br>
                            The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.<br>
                            Is water wood to serve a brook the same?<br>
                            How else dispose of an immortal force<br>
                            No longer needed? Staunch it at its source<br>
                            With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown<br>
                            Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone<br>
                            In fetid darkness still to live and run -<br>
                            And all for nothing it had ever done<br>
                            Except forget to go in fear perhaps.<br>
                            No one would know except for ancient maps<br>
                            That such a brook ran water. But I wonder<br>
                            If, from its being kept forever under,<br>
                            These thoughts may not have risen that so keep<br>
                            This new-built city from both work and sleep.<br>
